### Design Consideration:

- One way to solve problem is start with 1 and increment 1 , multiply same number and check with input.

- This solution requires linear increment worst case time complexity will be O(n/2) 

- Compare to Binary search This may not be ideal solution.
- Hence Selecting Binary search will be better choice for Time Complextity

### Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity : O(logn)
- Space Complextity: O(1) Constant
