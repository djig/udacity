### Design Consideration:

- Solution can achieve by divide and recursion strategy like sorting.

- Solution can achieve by just looping one time using (min, max) pointer variables with -infinity and +infinity However I am not sure I am allowed to use any Math library for this solution Hence I went with Divide and Recursion solution.

### Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity : O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(2) = O(1)
