Design COnsideration:
I can achieve this divide and recursion strategy like sorting.
Base condtion would be 1 element or two elements and compare them,
I can achieve min and max with Time Complexity O(n)
I can achieve this solution by just looping one time using min and max variable and initially with -infinity and +infinity However I am not sure I am allowed to use any match library for this solution Hence I went with Divide and Recursion solution.

Time Complexity : O(n)
Space Complexity: O(2) = O(1)
